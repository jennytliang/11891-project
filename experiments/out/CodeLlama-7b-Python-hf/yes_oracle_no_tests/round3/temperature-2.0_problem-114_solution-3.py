"""
You are given a non-empty array of integers.

One element appears exactly once, with every other element appearing at least twice, possibly more.

Write a function that can find and return the element that appears exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,1,2,1,2,80]
Output: 80
Note: You should be able to solve this problem in linear time and use only constant extra space.

    Given an array of integers nums, write a function that returns the "missing number" in linear time using a constant amount of memory.

The "missing number" is the number that appears exactly once in the array.

The array may contain duplicates.

Note: Your algorithm should preferably run in linear time and use only constant memory.
