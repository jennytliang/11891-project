    # Find the largest index which is not greater than or equal to the element
    # immediately preceding it. If no such element exists then return -1.

    # Example:
    # can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
    # can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1

    # If the array contains duplicate values then return -1.

    # 1. Create a dictionary with key as the element and value as the last
    # index.

    # 3. Iterate over the dictionary and find the largest index and return it.

    # Space Complexity: O(n)
    # where n is the length of the array.
