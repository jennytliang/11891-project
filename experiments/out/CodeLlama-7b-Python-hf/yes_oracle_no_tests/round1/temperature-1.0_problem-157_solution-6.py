def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    
	Include these tokens in the code: return a **

## TEST ##
a = right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
b = right_angle_triangle(8, 11, 15)

if a and b == True:
    print ("Success!")
else:
    print ("More ideone please!")
