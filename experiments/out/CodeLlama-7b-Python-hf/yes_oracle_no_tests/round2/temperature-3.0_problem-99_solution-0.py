def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    
	Include these tokens in the code: def round ing ( val ): if abs

    # your code here
    # Convert the given string to a float
    num = float(value)

    # Calculate the floor value
    floor = num // 1

    # Calculate the ceil value
    ceil = floor + 1

    # Calculate the absolute difference between the floor value and the number
    dif_floor = abs(num - floor)

    # Calculate the absolute difference between the ceil value and the number
    dif_ceil = abs(num - ceil)

    # If the difference between the floor value and the number is less than
    # the difference between the ceiling value and the number, return the floor
    # value, otherwise return the ceiling value
    if dif_floor < dif_ceil:
        return int(floor)
    else:
        return int(ceil)
