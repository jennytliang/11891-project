    Plan

    Loop through the string until the end
    Check if the character is an uppercase vowel
    Check if the loop number is even
        If the tests are true, add 1 to count

    # Additional notes: 
    - In Python the first character in a string has an index of 1
    Incorrect results for all of these:
    dBBE
    dBbE
    dBBe
    DDDdde
    dBBED
    dBBDe
    AA
    dBbEf
        - Add space to end of string
        - Does this help?
