    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:

        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.
