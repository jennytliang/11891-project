Hint #1:
One line solution.
Example:
>>> print('' if xs else ' '.join(xs))
Note: '' represents the NULL string.
Example #2:
>>> print("{}" if x == '' else "{{ {} }}".format(
    ''.join(map(lambda e: '{'+e+'}+{}+{', x))))

There are better ways to format output.
But since you are beginner, we'll keep them simple for now. Feel free to ask us for hints on that part if needed :)
Note: This might be the easiest implementation for this solution. But it gives you the wrong result for ["1","","{}"]
Why? ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜… Because it uses the first non empty argument for the default formatting argument to print. And it should be a string or a string formatted using formatting arguments.
